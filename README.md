Recipe Project - The Odin Project

This project is a practical application of the HTML foundations of Web Development learned through The Odin Project. The goal was to build a basic recipe website while mastering the core building blocks of HTML.

During this exercise, I implemented and practiced the following concepts:

1. HTML Structure & Semantics

Organizing a document using <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>.

Using hierarchy with headings (<h1>, <h3>) to create a logical flow.

Structuring content with paragraphs (<p>) and line breaks (<br>).

2. Working with Lists

Unordered Lists (<ul>): Used for ingredients where the order doesn't matter.

Ordered Lists (<ol>): Used for step-by-step instructions to ensure a logical sequence.

3. Media & Navigation

Images: Adding images using the <img> tag and managing their dimensions.

Hyperlinks: Creating internal links to navigate between pages and external links to credit recipe authors.
